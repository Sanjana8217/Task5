Titanic EDA Project
Overview:
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights affecting passenger survival.
Objective:
Identify factors influencing survival
Visualize distributions, correlations, and relationships in the data
Dataset:
Includes passenger details: PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked
Target variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Missing values in Age, Cabin, Embarked
Tools & Libraries
Python 3.x
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
Key Findings:
Women and children had higher survival rates
Higher-class passengers survived more than 3rd class
Fare positively correlated with survival
Age had minor influence; children slightly more likely to survive
